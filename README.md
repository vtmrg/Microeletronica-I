# Microelectronics I Projects - VHDL Implementations

This repository contains the projects developed for the Microelectronics I course, written in VHDL, with practical implementation using the Spartan 3E 500 FPGA.

## Description
### Final Project
- **Project:** STOP Game, using the VGA output of the Nexys 2 kit.

Linear Shift Register: Generates pseudo-random numbers for game mechanics.
VGA Driver: Written in VHDL, supports a resolution of 800x600 pixels.
Game State Machine: Controls the game logic, transitions, and state handling.
Seven-Segment Display Scrolling: Displays scrolling text on a seven-segment display.


### Lab 1
- **Project 1:** Multiplexer and a flip-flop.
- **Project 2:** Same code with input signals (a, b, c, d), output signals (x, y), and the mux signal with 1-bit dimension, including pin mapping on the board.

### Lab 2
- **Project 1:** BCD to 7-segment decoder.
- **Project 2:** Hamming weight (counts the number of ones in an input vector).
- **Project 3:** Binary sorter using the GENERATE statement.
- **Project 4:** Arithmetic circuit - mini ALU.

### Lab 3
- **Project 1:** Timer: Counter from 0 to 9, incrementing every half second and resetting when the maximum value is reached.
- **Project 2:** Counter from 0 to 9 that increments or decrements each time the button (bt) is pressed. Debouncing the button is necessary.

### Lab 4
- **Project:** Digital Clock.

### Lab 5
- **Project:** Garage Door Controller.
